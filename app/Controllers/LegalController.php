<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<div class="updated">Last updated: July 2026</div>

<p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of Tourfecto (the "Platform", "we", "us"), a SaaS platform providing AI-powered marketing, reputation management, and business intelligence tools for tourism and hospitality businesses. By creating an account or using the Platform, you agree to these Terms.</p>

<h2>1. The Service</h2>
<p>Tourfecto provides tools including but not limited to: reputation and review management, AI-generated marketing content (articles, ad copy, social media posts), competitor monitoring, CRM and sales pipeline tracking, revenue analytics, website technical audits, and integrations with third-party platforms (Google Business Profile, Meta Ads, TripAdvisor, WhatsApp via UltraMsg).</p>

<h2>2. Accounts</h2>
<p>You must provide accurate information when creating an account and are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials. You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your account, including actions taken by staff members you invite.</p>

<h2>3. AI-Generated Content</h2>
<p>Some features use third-party AI models (currently Google Gemini) to generate text such as review replies, articles, and ad copy. AI-generated content is provided as a draft or suggestion only. You are solely responsible for reviewing, editing, and approving any AI-generated content before it is published, sent to a customer, or used publicly. We do not guarantee the accuracy, appropriateness, or factual correctness of AI-generated output.</p>

<h2>4. Third-Party Integrations</h2>
<p>The Platform may connect to third-party services on your behalf when you explicitly authorize it (OAuth), including Google Business Profile, Meta Marketing API, TripAdvisor, and UltraMsg (WhatsApp Business API). Your use of those integrations is also subject to the respective third party's own terms of service. We are not responsible for the availability, accuracy, or policies of third-party platforms.</p>

<h2>5. Subscriptions and Billing</h2>
<p>Certain features require a paid subscription plan. Fees are billed in advance on a recurring basis as described at checkout. You may cancel your subscription at any time; cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period. Fees are non-refundable except where required by law.</p>

<h2>6. Acceptable Use</h2>
<ul>
    <li>You may not use the Platform to send spam, unsolicited bulk messages, or misleading content to customers.</li>
    <li>You may not attempt to reverse-engineer, scrape, or overload the Platform's infrastructure.</li>
    <li>You may not use the Platform to process data you do not have a lawful right to process (e.g., customer contact details collected without appropriate consent or legal basis).</li>
    <li>You are responsible for complying with applicable advertising, consumer protection, and data protection laws in the jurisdictions where you operate.</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>The Platform, its software, design, and branding are owned by Tourfecto. Content you upload (your business data, customer data, media) remains yours; you grant us a limited license to process it solely to provide the Service to you.</p>

<h2>8. Termination</h2>
<p>We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms, engage in fraudulent activity, or pose a security risk to the Platform or other users. You may close your account at any time; see our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> for how your data is handled after account closure.</p>

<h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>The Platform is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted by law, Tourfecto is not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, including loss of revenue, arising from your use of the Platform, including reliance on AI-generated content or third-party integration data.</p>

<h2>10. Changes to These Terms</h2>
<p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Material changes will be communicated via the Platform or email. Continued use after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

<h2>11. Contact</h2>
<p>Questions about these Terms can be sent via our <a href="/help/contact">contact page</a>.</p>

<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<div class="updated">Last updated: July 2026</div>

<p>This Privacy Policy explains how Tourfecto ("we", "us") collects, uses, and protects information when you use our platform.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p><strong>Account information:</strong> company name, email address, phone number, and password (stored hashed, never in plain text).</p>
<p><strong>Customer/review data you import or connect:</strong> when you connect Google Business Profile, TripAdvisor, or similar platforms, we process reviewer names, review text, ratings, and — where the source platform provides it — reviewer email or phone number. Sensitive fields such as email and phone are encrypted at rest.</p>
<p><strong>CRM data:</strong> contact and lead information you or your team enter into the Platform's CRM module.</p>
<p><strong>Usage data:</strong> login history, IP address, device/browser type, and general activity logs, used for account security (e.g., detecting suspicious logins) and service improvement.</p>
<p><strong>Content you generate:</strong> AI prompts and generated content (articles, ad copy, replies) are processed to provide the feature and may be temporarily sent to our AI provider (Google Gemini) to generate a response.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies:</strong> we use a minimal set of cookies — a session/authentication cookie, and a language-preference cookie (<code>tf_lang</code>) that remembers your chosen interface language. We do not use third-party advertising or tracking cookies.</p>

<h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
<ul>
    <li>To provide and operate the Platform's features (reputation management, CRM, analytics, AI content generation).</li>
    <li>To communicate with you about your account, billing, or support requests.</li>
    <li>To detect and prevent fraud, abuse, or security incidents.</li>
    <li>To improve the Platform based on aggregate, non-identifying usage patterns.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Third Parties We Share Data With</h2>
<p>We share data only as needed to provide the Service, and only with your explicit connection/authorization for platform integrations:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Google (Gemini API, Google Business Profile API):</strong> AI content generation and review syncing, when you connect a Google Business account.</li>
    <li><strong>Meta (Marketing API):</strong> ad campaign data, only when you connect a Meta Ads account.</li>
    <li><strong>TripAdvisor API:</strong> review syncing, when connected.</li>
    <li><strong>UltraMsg:</strong> our WhatsApp Business messaging provider, used to send/receive WhatsApp messages if you enable the Smart Chat feature.</li>
    <li><strong>Payment processor:</strong> to process subscription payments. We do not store full payment card numbers ourselves.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not sell your data or your customers' data to third parties for advertising purposes.</p>

<h2>4. Data Security</h2>
<p>Sensitive personal fields (such as customer email and phone numbers collected via reviews) are encrypted at rest. Passwords are hashed and never stored in plain text. We restrict internal access to production data to authorized personnel only.</p>

<h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
<p>We retain account and customer data for as long as your account is active, or as needed to provide the Service. You may request deletion of your account and associated data at any time (see Section 6).</p>

<h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
<p>Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, export, or delete your personal data. You can request a data export or account deletion via your account settings or by contacting us through the <a href="/help/contact">contact page</a>. We aim to respond to verified requests within 30 days.</p>

<h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>The Platform is intended for business use and is not directed at children. We do not knowingly collect personal data from individuals under 16.</p>

<h2>8. International Data Transfers</h2>
<p>Our infrastructure and some third-party processors (including our AI and hosting providers) may process data outside your country. We take reasonable steps to ensure such transfers are protected consistent with this Policy.</p>

<h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will note the "Last updated" date above when changes are made; material changes will be communicated via the Platform or email.</p>

<h2>10. Contact</h2>
<p>For privacy questions or data requests, please use our <a href="/help/contact">contact page</a>.</p>

<h1>Cookie Policy</h1>
<div class="updated">Last updated: July 2026</div>
<p>Tourfecto uses a minimal set of cookies necessary for the Platform to function:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Session/authentication cookie</strong> — keeps you logged in securely.</li>
    <li><strong>Language preference cookie (<code>tf_lang</code>)</strong> — remembers your chosen interface language (English, Arabic, French, or German).</li>

<h1>Data Deletion Instructions</h1>
<div class="updated">Last updated: July 2026</div>

<p>If you connected Tourfecto through Facebook/Meta Login, or if you'd like any personal data we hold about you or your business deleted, follow the steps below.</p>

<h2>How to Request Deletion</h2>
<ol style="color:#C9D2E0;font-size:14.5px;line-height:1.9;padding-inline-start:22px;">
    <li>Send a deletion request through our <a href="/help/contact">contact page</a>, using the email address associated with your Tourfecto account.</li>
    <li>Include your account email and, if applicable, the connected platform (Google, Meta, TripAdvisor, WhatsApp) you'd like disconnected.</li>
    <li>We verify the request against the account on file, then permanently delete your account data — including profile information, connected platform tokens, and imported customer/review data — from our production systems.</li>
    <li>We aim to complete verified deletion requests within 30 days, and will confirm by email once complete.</li>
</ol>

<h2>What Gets Deleted</h2>
<p>Account and profile information, OAuth connection tokens for any linked platform (Google Business, Meta Ads, TripAdvisor), imported review and CRM data, and uploaded media. Some records may be retained for a limited period where required by law (e.g., billing records for tax compliance) or to prevent fraud.</p>

<h2>Disconnecting Just the Meta Integration</h2>
<p>If you only want to disconnect Meta Ads without deleting your whole Tourfecto account, you can do this yourself from the Ads page in your dashboard ("Disconnect" button), or by removing Tourfecto's access from your own Facebook Business settings.</p>

<p>See also our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="/gdpr">GDPR & Data Rights</a> page.</p>
